# AutoDiscordWebhook
Set a timer to send a Discord Webhook every (x) seconds!


**Automated Discord Webhook Sender**

1.) Adjust settings.json to your Webhook

2.) Adjust Discord Webhook message

3.) Adjust time.sleep(60) to desired time

Notes:

* I've included a time conversion in time.txt since time.sleep() is in seconds

* DM me on Discord if you have any issues - xStar#2222
